Open Reactive Transport interface 3D

 

## **Overview**

 

ORTI3D is a 3D interface for modelling groundwater flow, transport and reactive processes with:

- The modular three-dimensional finite-difference groundwater model **MODFLOW** of the USGS (Harbaugh et al., 2000).
- The solute transport model **MT3DMS** (Zheng and Wang, 1999).
- The saturated-unsaturated, fluid-density-dependent groundwater flow and transport model **SEAWAT **(Langevin et al., 2008).
- The saturated-unsaturated, fluid-density-dependent groundwater flow and transport model **SUTRA **(Voss, 1984)**.**
- The reactive transport codes **PHT3D** (Prommer et al., 2001).
- The saturated-unsaturated reactive transport code **MIN3P **(Mayer et al., 2012).
- The thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical numerical code **OPENGEOSYS** (Kolditz et al., 2012).
- The parameter estimation program **PEST** (Doherty, 2005). 

Features in ORTI3D allow you to:

- Implement 2D, 3D and radial model.
- Quickly dimension the model domain and select units, as well as, easily assign model properties and boundary conditions.     
- Write input files and run model of the aforesaid numerical codes. 
- Write the files necessary to use the parameter estimation program, PEST.
- Easily assign data input. A background value is specified over the whole domain and modifications are done by adding zones within which the parameters value is different. This allows to easily modify the spatial discretization of the model during the model building process.
- Interpolate input data from wells (topography or hydraulic conductivity).
- Write more complex input data through the use of formulas.
- Run Python scripts in the batch module of the interface.
- Visualize and export results.
